# CACCC_Resource_Database

This project was created for the Children's Advocacy Center of Collin County (CACCC). The project has been developed using [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), and [Express](https://expressjs.com/). 
The goal of the project was to streamline creating, updating, reading, and deleting resource data for CACCCC. We created a web app and our main goal was to create an application with a simple and straightforward UI.
